## Hello, the name's Lee Hong Hui ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying developing as a backend developer since going thru the online learning platform [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).
[Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) made me build a web server, which was an eye-opener for me, which made me want to discover more tools and concepts.
I'm excited to work on a team and explore how we can make an impact.
