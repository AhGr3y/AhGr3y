## Hello, the name's Lee Hong Hui ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying my journey as a backend developer every since I started learning through the online learning platform [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).\
Building a web server on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) was an eye-opening experience sparked my curiosity to explore more tools and concepts.\
I'm excited to work on a team and discover how we can make an impact together. If you're looking to hire, I'd love to chat!
